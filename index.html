    <h2>About The Game</h2>
    <p>This game was initially a test I built while I was bored. I had just sloppily put together a few rooms, like a straight room, a right curve, left curve, and ones that go up and down. I then started to test out procedural generation. Basically just taking those rooms, and plopping them together as the player walks through them. At the time, I was mainly working on an old boating game which was named Lake Hammon at the time, which I now gave ownership of that game to @15Borden, one of our QA members. After a while, I kind of grew on the procedural generation. system, because I liked how fast it was, and how high-quality, and just overall how good it was. I then shifted my focus over to that, and began modelling some rooms for it. Believe it or not, but the game was initially supposed to be set in a sort of abandoned office/bunker/cave sort of thing, I hadn't really thought about a story, but over time I started adding more cave elements, as I seem to be good at that. I've made three (3) horror games in my life, ESCAPE, DreadWorks, and The Caverns. ESCAPE and DreadWorks were both cave themed, but filled with free models. The Caverns though, I made most of it myself. As I was adding more cave themed stuff, I just said screw it, lets just make it entirely cave themed. Then after many, many, many remodels, and graphics rehauls, and system rehauls, I built the first version of the game we know today. At that point, I was getting serious about it, so I gathered some friends, and some other people and built a Discord server, and thats when stuff really took off, I got QA members, and learned tons of new things like animating, and increased my already heavily developed scripting, and modelling skills and yea, I'm a small single developer who is genuinly passionate about making games. I'm honest when I say this, my main priority isn't making money. Yes, it would be nice, but I really just want to make one good quality game, and get it out there! That's my biggest goal in life is to be known in the developer community and to have people genuinly enjoy my game. I don't care about making millions, or getting stuff done quickly, its entirely the 'Quality Over Quantity' rule, and I follow that closely. I hope you enjoy the game, and thanks for reading this.</p>
